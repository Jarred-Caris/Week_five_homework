Work Planner

## Week five home work project

Our fifth week project was to create a day planner that would display the current date, would allow tasks to be saved to local storage and that a colour system would display, representing past, present and future in relation to the current timeframe

## This is the end result

## My contribution

For our week five project, we were instructed to created a day planer that is reactive to the time of day.

This project was quite a fun one and i found it very interesting using moment js and the ease of it.

My intital plan was to use loops and arrays for the scripting but after much trying, and not getting it to work the way I wanted, I change my plan and went down the route im submitting.

I felt better with this project and did not need to rely as much on the support team. I still used office hours to check my code with the TA and enlisted in the additional tutoring to troubleshoot my faults. But i felt more confident completing this project than the last few.

**explaining my page**
I am very suprised how little code was involved in getting the results. Due to this i was able to experiment a little more and didnt feel as rushed as i did with the quiz just to finish.

I used youtube videos, tutorials, stack overflow and office hours to get my code working.

I really feel good using Jquery. Javascript was a large concern for me and still is. Jquery seems alot easier for me to read and determine what code is needed.

I did want to add a few other things to the page. Having the tasks clear when the date changes. Being able to choose future dates to enter tasks.I talked with the TA about implementing these and how it would work but didnt feel confident enough to add to my code. But when im more confident, i will come back and add these fetures for my learning.
